# Front-End Portfolio Project
---
I decided to work with The Met Museum's API, and build a web application that allows the user to search and explore the extensive collection of the museum.
There are currently 480k+ items, and more artifacts are added regularly to the data.

### Instructions To Open and Use The Application
---
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory on your command line.
3. Open up the repository in VSCode, by typing in the command code .
4. Select the option **Go Live** at the bottom right corner of VSCode.
5. Now you may make your first search using the search form, or simply view a random item by selecting the view random item option.

### User Stores
---
* As a user, when the page first loads I will see the total number of items in the data. The value is updated when the application starts.
* As a user, I am able to navigate to a few other pages by selecting the links in the **Header** section.
* As a user, I may search the museum's collection by entering one or more keywords in the search box.
* As a user, I have a few search options I may select to narrow down my search. I may choose to search in the **title** or in the **artist or culture** fields. I may select a museum department, and search items that are **Museum Highlights** and/or on display.
* As a user, after submitting my search form, I will see the first item's information populate the main section. The list of results will be right below.
* As a user, after I perform a search. If there are more than 30 search results, I may select the option to load more results.
* As a user, I may click one of the search results to update the main section with its data.
* As a user, I may choose to view a random item of the collection by clicking on the button **view random item**.

*The application's look and its features are likely to be updated*
