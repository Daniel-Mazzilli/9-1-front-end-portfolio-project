# Front-End-Portfolio-Project

## Daniel Mazzilli

I will work with The Met Museum's API. The objective is to explore the museum's collection.

### User Stories

- As a user, I will have a couple of links I may click to navigate to different pages
- As a user, I will have search options to navigate the extensive collection of the Met
- As a user, I may select with Museum Department to search in
- As a user, I may enter keywords in my search query
- As a user, I may select works that are highlighted
- As a user, my search results will appear in the main section of the page
- As a user, I can load a next list of items to display from my search results
- As a user, I can see result information and data for each item
- As a user, I may click a link and be taken to the official Met's page for that item

*More functionality and ideas to be added as I work on the project*
