          Hello! My name is Daniel Mazzilli. The Metropolitan Museum of Art has
          always been one of my favorite places in NYC. Since a young age my
          mother every summer would take me and my siblings to visit the Met.
          While in middle school and in high school I did summer intensive
          programs there, which included sketching, water color
          painting, and art history lectures. During my college days I took art
          history classes, which also required me to explore the Met, and choose
          items from its immense collection to research and write papers on.
          Needless to say I have incredibly fond memories of those times. Of
          course, I still try to make regular visit to the Met.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working with the Met's API was an easy choice. The idea was to create
          a search engine application with the purpose of exploring and gaining
          access to the museum's incredible collection. It is still a work in
          progress, and I look forward to improving my current code, as well as
          adding additional features. If you enjoy my build and/or have any
          advice and recommendations, do not hesitate to reach out.
